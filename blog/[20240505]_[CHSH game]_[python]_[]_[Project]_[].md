### Deutsch's Algorithm

> Assumption : f(x) : {0,1} -> {0,1}. The result is either 0 or 1 depending on input value x, but we don't know the actual value of 
f(0) and f(1). Also, calculation of f(x) takes a long time, so we want to minimize the number of f(x) calculation.

> Challenging : Can we decide whether the value of f(0) and f(1) are the same or different only through a single calculation?

> we need to use the **quantum superposition** of the input state and **quantum interference**
